## Abstract

This project allows users to view and answer a series of flashcards within terminal. It will notify users of incorrect answers, and return a total percentage of answers answered correctly upon completed the deck. This project contains test files that implement the mocha testing framework and the chai assertion library.

## Install/Setup
Flashcards runs in terminal:
To install and run: `git clone` this repository from github. From within terminal, `cd` into the repository and run `node index.js`.

## Functionality

Users are able to begin the game, and run through the flashcard set from within terminal.

### Wins and Challenges
Wins include gaining a greater understanding of the mocha testing framework and chai assertion library.

The biggest challenge faced during this project was attempting to implement a new set of cards from a separate file, and giving players the option to choose which set. These were not included, as the branch builds were not functioning correctly. However I gained a better understanding of how these files are interacting through json files. It also gave me a chance to practice pulling a previous iteration down from Github to overwrite faulty code, something I had never done before.
